  This is what I did. <br>
  When I saw the original example  (here is the <a href="http://paperjs.org/examples/smoothing/")>link</a>
  I think it's really cool.<br>
  I want to use it to emulate the waves.<br>
  I add a new path and made modification on the color and height of the path
  so that I can hav different waves.
